## Calculators

Sometimes, you may find yourself consistently using a complex model, changing only a few input metrics and checking only
a few output metrics each time. In this case, it may be more helpful to create a _calculator_ from that model.
Calculators allow you to isolate a small number of input nodes and output nodes to display as a form rather than a
model. Any viewer of the space can then enter different numbers for the selected inputs, and the selected outputs,
computed using the rest of the model's saved inputs, will be displayed.

Here is an [example caluclator](https://www.getguesstimate.com/calculators/70),
created from [this model](https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/4457):

Calculators are especially useful when a model serves as a template, to be used repeatedly with different inputs, or
when you want to survey many people about their predictions. To create a calculator, click on the 'calculator' icon
within the modeling toolbar. Then, you will see a menu that will allow you to create a new calculator. You will be able
to select which inputs you want to present to the user, and which outputs to display upon calculation.
