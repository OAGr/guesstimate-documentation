The standard view shows the average observed value and the 90% confidence interval (CI) around that value; in this example, the node says that 90% of the time, the number of months you could survive is within 6.5 - 3.2 = 3.3 and 6.5 + 3.2 = 9.7 months.

The expanded view shows the same mean and CI (red box) and a table of percentiles (blue box). Percentiles show how likely it is that the observed value would fall below a threshold; here, there is a 1% chance that you could only survive for fewer than 3.08 months, and a 95% chance that you could only survive for fewer than 9.539 months.

To ask, "How often will I be able to survive for more than 9.539 months?", simply subtract the percentile for that value (95%) from 100%. Here, you could survive for more than 9.539 months only 5% of the time.
