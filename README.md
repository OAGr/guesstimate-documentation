# Guesstimate

Guesstimate is an app that helps you run Monte Carlo simulations on things with uncertainty.

## Make Beautiful Spreadsheets

Guesstimate is a spreadsheet tool, similar to Excel or Google Sheets. Each model is a grid of cells. Each cell can represent a metric with a name and value. Equations can be used to connect metrics to other, dependent metrics.

## Use Numbers With Uncertainty

In addition to working with exact values, Guesstimate can be used for metrics with uncertainty. For instance, if you want to guesstimate the number of sandals in a store, you can instead enter a range that you think would contain the number of sandals in the store. For instance, if you type '10 to 90' into a cell, this means that you are 90% confident that the number of sandals in the store is between 10 and 90. The math would be done on this entire range for dependent values, in a statistically meaningful way.

## Share Your Results

Most models on Guesstimate are public. These can be adjusted by anyone, but can only be saved by their owners. To share a public model with a friend, copy the url for that model and send it to them.
